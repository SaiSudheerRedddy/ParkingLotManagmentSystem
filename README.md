# ParkingLotManagmentSystem
We have implemented a parking lot management system using the concepts of oops and cpp.
We designed the system using object oriented programming. 

The main functionalities are :
1. You can check the status of the parking lot.
2. Generate a ticket when the car enters.
3. Calculate the charges.
4. Generate a receipt when the car exits.
5. Admin can add or remove the parking lots or change the cost for parking.
